# Satellite Station-Keeping Simulator (DSAS) — LQR Control (MATLAB/Simulink)

This project implements a satellite station-keeping / relative motion simulator used in the context of a DSAS engineering study. The goal is to maintain a satellite at an autonomous “hold position” (near an equilibrium point) using state-space modeling and LQR feedback control, with simulation performed in Simulink.
